Khula खुला 
=====

Khula is a Devanagari typeface family designed by [Erin McLaughlin](http://www.erinmclaughlin.com). 

The style and weights of Khula Devanagari were designed as a complement to the Latin glyphs of [Open Sans](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans), a family designed by Steve Matteson.

Khula will be available for free via the Google Web Fonts project.
